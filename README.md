This is a program to simulate the relationships between the images in the real space and Fourier tansformed images.

The real images can be constructed by several components of waves, and each component is added or multiplied to form a single image.
In addition, additional processes (such as smoothing, random noise, etc.) can be applied on the images.
Two images can be further mearged to form a image.
All of the images can be converted by Fourier transormation.
